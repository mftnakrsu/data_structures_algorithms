# Data Structures and Algorithms

I will share my work on data structures.

| Data Structure | Link |
| --- | --- |
| Array |        [Code ](https://github.com/mftnakrsu/data_structures_algorithms/blob/main/data_structures/array.py) |
| Stack - Queue - Deque |        [Code ](https://github.com/mftnakrsu/data_structures_algorithms/blob/main/data_structures/stack_queue_deque.py)|

## Job Interview Questions:

1) Why is dynamic array important? 

        Auto resize
    
2) What is the difference between array and dynamic array?

        Array is fixed size, you need to specify it when creating the array at the beginning.   
        Dynamic Array, There is no need to specify size at the beginning in dynamic array.
        
        
3) What are the advantages and disadvantages of dynamic array?

        Advantages :
        
        fast lookup: istenilen arraydeki degeri elde etmesi o(1)
        variable size : resizeable
                         
        Disadvantage:
        
        slow worst case appends: If there is no space, it is necessary to increase the capacity slowly o(n)
        costly inters and delete O(n)
